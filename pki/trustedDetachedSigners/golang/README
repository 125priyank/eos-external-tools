The latest "Google Inc. (Linux Packages Signing Authority)" key
is available from https://dl.google.com/dl/linux/linux_signing_key.pub
Apparently it is rotated annually.

wget -O golangPubKey.pem https://dl.google.com/dl/linux/linux_signing_key.pub

There are no links for the detached signatures for go releases from the main
golang.org/dl page, and they don't appear to be well documented.
However they are officially supported on an ongoing basis - see
https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14739

In summary, every https://dl.google.com/go/X linked from the download page
(golang.org/dl) also has a corresponding detached signature available at
https://dl.google.com/go/X.asc which can be verified with the
linux_signing_key.pub in force when it was released.

For golang in EOS, we fetch and build the goX.Y.Z.src.tar.gz sources.
/src/golang/update-sources.sh takes care of downloading the current signing
key, checking if it matches the one here (to detect when it was rotated),
downloading and verifying the .tar.gz and .tar.gz.asc files.
For good measure, the script also checks the sha256 can be found in the HTML
for https://golang.org/dl/
