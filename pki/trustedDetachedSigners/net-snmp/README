This key was obtained from the SourceForge git repository
representing the net-snmp project's website:
git://git.code.sf.net/p/net-snmp/htdocs
because the website itself does not support https,
so there was no way to validate that the key is
not modified in transit by just accessing the URL.

I used Google Hangouts to speak with Wes Hardaker,
who I've known for years, and he stated that he performed
the commit to the repository that added this key.
